## About me
Greetings! I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in several programming languages (although I love Python the most) and testing tools. My journey in software development has equipped me with experience in Python and frameworks like Flask and Django. Python has become my go-to tool for turning ideas into functional solutions. I'm well-versed in testing methodologies, leveraging tools like Selenium for robust testing procedures, and have experience in manual testing as well. Additionally, I'm skilled in utilizing version control systems like GitHub and have a solid grasp of database management with MySQL. My project experiences and academic pursuits have equipped me with the practical skills needed to tackle various challenges.
