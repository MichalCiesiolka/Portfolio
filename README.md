## About me
I am Computer Science Student with a strong passion for both programming and software testing. Proficient in Python, I use it daily not only for programming tasks but also for conducting various testing activities to ensure the quality of software products. Driven by my curiosity and enthusiasm, I find joy in exploring the intricate details of software testing and have gained valuable experience in documenting bugs and tracking issues using Jira. My programming background allows me to approach testing with a developer's mindset, enabling me to identify potential defects more effectively and work collaboratively with development teams to implement solutions. In addition to manual testing, I have a solid foundation in automation testing using Selenium and pytest. I have developed a simple Framework for website testing using Selenium, which has further enhanced my understanding of automated testing techniques. While I am still exploring Java, I have successfully applied it in a project involving a Currency Converter Program that utilizes web scraping to extract exchange rates from Google.

## My Experience
### Python
- Pomodoro Timer - versatile and user-friendly time management tool inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. It enables users to customize work and break intervals, offers visual and auditory alerts, tracks statistics, and even allows saving preferences to an external configuration file for seamless continuity.

### Django
- To-Do List - task management system designed to empower users with efficient task tracking and organization. With features such as user authentication, authorization, and the ability to create, update, delete, and finish tasks, it offers a comprehensive solution for users to manage their tasks effectively. Task attributes including ID, name, description, creator, deadlines, and timestamps enable users to stay organized, while administrators have special privileges for seamless task management.
